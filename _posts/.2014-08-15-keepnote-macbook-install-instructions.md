**KeepNote** is my favorite tool for note keeping during penetration tests, it's advertised as cross platform and works great on Linux and Windows. But getting it to work on **OSX** takes a bit of work, if you are prepared to jump through some hoops I've documented the installation process below. 

##Install Homebrew

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) is a package manager for OSX, it allows you to install applications in a similar way to BSD ports. 

{% highlight bash %}
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
{% endhighlight %}

After running the Brew command the following **Apple Developer Tools** box will appears, click install (you no longer have to install Xcode).

Output:
{% highlight bash %}
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
==> This script will install:
/usr/local/bin/brew
/usr/local/Library/...
/usr/local/share/man/man1/brew.1

Press RETURN to continue or any other key to abort
==> /usr/bin/sudo /bin/mkdir /usr/local

WARNING: Improper use of the sudo command could lead to data loss
or the deletion of important system files. Please double-check your
typing when using sudo. Type "man sudo" for more information.

To proceed, enter your password, or type Ctrl-C to abort.

Password:
==> /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod g+rwx /usr/local
==> /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/chgrp admin /usr/local
==> /usr/bin/sudo /bin/mkdir /Library/Caches/Homebrew
==> /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod g+rwx /Library/Caches/Homebrew
==> Installing the Command Line Tools (expect a GUI popup):
==> /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/xcode-select --install
xcode-select: note: install requested for command line developer tools
Press any key when the installation has completed.

Download:

[PyGTK](http://sourceforge.net/projects/macpkg/files/PyGTK/2.24.0/PyGTK.pkg/download)

[Xquartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/)

## Install pyGTK & Xquartz

Install pyGTK, double click the download run through the options, you'll be prompted for your password.

Then do the same for Xquartz and reboot.

Download and extract the latest KeepNote somewhere sensible, like /usr/local/share/ and cd into the bin dir and execute ./keepnote - KeepNote will then open, my install complained about some missing fonts in the terminal when launching.

I've chosen not to worry about the missing fonts.
